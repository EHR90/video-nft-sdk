# Getting Started

This is an video NFT minting dapp that allows users to upload a video NFT through Livepeer Studio where the asset is transcoded. Then it is stored to IPFS and minted on Polygon.

Due to the slow nature of playbacks when obtaining assets from decentralized storage such as IPFS, Livepeer Studio acts as a caching layer to provide fast and reliable user experience when playing back the asset.
